### My spotify data analysis

I've downloaded my personal data from Spotify and decided to create a simple report to be updated over time.

Rstudio is required to knit the .Rmd file.

### How to use it
- Open mySpotify.Rproj;
- Copy your uncompressed .json data (particularly "StreamingHistory" and "YourLibrary") to /MyData inside the project path;
- Open main.Rmd;
- Click on "Knit to HTML".

A file "main.html" will be created with your report

Go crazy.
